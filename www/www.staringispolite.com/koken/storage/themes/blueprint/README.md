#Blueprint theme for Koken

Blueprint is a very basic [Koken](http://koken.me) theme that demonstrates in the simplest way possible to Lens templates, variables and tags that may be used to built a site theme. Every document is fully commented and incorporates only what's necessary to publish data. Blueprint isn't intended for actual site use but rather as a learning aid for web developers and designers interested in building their own theme.

###Installation

Once downloaded, add the “blueprint” folder to Koken's `koken/storage/themes` directory to see it in action.
