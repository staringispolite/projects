<h1>
  Like, Python
</h1>

<h2>
  DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<p>
  OMG! It's like Python, but like, you know, casual!
</p>
<p>
  Now you can toootally do just about everything you can do in that old, 
  uptight language Python, but be like, so cool about it, bro!
</p>

<h2>
  INSTALLATION
</h2>
<p>
  To install, like, pretty much just make sure you have admin privileges
  on your machine and type the following from inside your likepython directory:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo cp ./likepython /usr/bin/
  sudo chmod 555 /usr/bin/likepython
</pre>
<p>
  So like, that should totally work right? If so, you can test in on the 
  hello world file included in the distro like so:
</p>
<pre>
  likepython hello_world.lp
</pre>

<h2>
  USAGE
</h2>
<p>
  LikePython simply adds keywords to python's lexical understanding -
  so Python is a subset of LikePython, so anything you've written in 
  python is valid LikePython. But you can also write like you'd speak,
  for example:
</p>
<pre>
  just print like "hello world" bro
</pre>
<p>
  or
</p>
<pre>
  ok so like if not input_var right:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;totally exit()
</pre>

<p>
A full list of LikePython keywords is below:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Valleygirl:	omg, so, like, totally, right, toootally
  </li>
  <li>
    Frat guy:	friggin, fuckin, dude, man, bro, broheim, broseph
  </li>
  <li>
    Internets:	lol, rofl, teh, ohai, plz
  </li>
  <li>
    Snoop:	yo, homey, homeboy, sup, dog, shit, girl, ma, biatch, ho, shiiit
  </li>
  <li>
    Local:	wicked, hella, anyways 
  </li>
  <li>
    Misc: 	just, hey, yeah, ok, um, uh, ah, actually, something
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
