Like, Python

DESCRIPTION
-----------
OMG! It's like Python, but like, you know, casual!

Now you can toootally do just about everything you can do in that old, uptight language Python, but be like, so cool about it, bro!


INSTALLATION
------------
To install, like, pretty much just make sure you have admin privileges on your machine and type the following from inside your likepython directory:

    sudo cp ./likepython /usr/bin/
    sudo chmod 555 /usr/bin/likepython

So like, that should totally work right? If so, you can test in on the hello world file included in the distro like so:

    likepython hello_world.lp


USAGE
-----
LikePython simply adds keywords to python's lexical understanding - so Python
is a subset of LikePython, so anything you've written in python is valid
LikePython. But you can also write like you'd speak, for example:

    print something like "hello world" bro
or
    ok so like if not input_var right:
      totally exit()

A full list of LikePython keywords is below:
    Valleygirl:	omg, so, like, totally, right, toootally
    Frat guy:	friggin, fuckin, dude, man, bro, broheim, broseph
    Internets:	lol, rofl, teh, ohai, plz
    Snoop:	yo, homey, homeboy, sup, dog, shit, girl, ma, biatch, ho, shiiit
    Local:	wicked, hella, anyways 
    Misc: 	just, hey, yeah, ok, um, uh, ah, actually, something
